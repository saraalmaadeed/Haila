# Haila

Hello, this is my first attempt at Github. Well, if you don't count that one repository I accidentally made just now.

This repository includes code for the alpha version of the game Haila which won the Ummahacks grand prize in 2020. It was made with Unity in C# and I was the sole programmer. I have uploaded a WebGL and a Windows/Mac/Linux application. You can try the latter first. If neither work, then future me will be pretty mad with all-nighter me.

Future Sara here! Unity closed Unity Connect, so there may be some problems working this. Sleep schedule fixed btw.

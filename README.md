# Haila

Hello, this is my first attempt at Github. Well, if you don't count that one repository I accidentally made just now.

I have uploaded a WebGL and a Windows/Mac/Linux application. You can try the latter first. If neither work, then future me will be pretty mad with all-nighter me.

Seriously, USA, get a new time zone. I mean, I know you have several, but join us here in GMT+3. You wouldn't have to get up at 3am for a Zoom call (or stagger the timings). Man, I hope my sleep schedule improves... it might be a lost cause.

Future Sara here! Unity closed Unity Connect, so there may be some problems working this. Sleep schedule fixed btw.
